[Med Device Helper](https://med-device-helper.herokuapp.com/)

Med Device Helper is an application that helps medical device reps keep track of their devices. 

Often times, medical sales professionals travel from hospital to hospital with their devices. These devices can either remain at the hospital as consignment or be dropped off as a loaner. While some hospitals have their own inventory management systems, most do not and often do little upkeep, leading to lost devices.
